=== Tackler release 25.05.1

[WARNING]
.Semantic change with `input.git.dir` and `input.git.ext`
====
This releases fixes the functionality of `input.git.dir` and `input.git.ext` so
that it is identical how `input.fs.dir` and `input.fs.ext` work. +
 +
With previous releases of tackler, `input.git.dir` and `input.git.ext` acted as
a glob pattern (prefix and suffix). Now `input.git.dir` will match the full
directory name (no glob at the end)  and `input.git.ext` will match the full
extension of the filename (no prefix glob).
====

==== New features and changes

New features:

* New output format JSON
  ** Optional configuration key `report.formats` to specify output formats.
  ** New optional CLI argument `--formats` to select report formats

Changed functionality:

* Git SCM Storage
  ** Enforce that `input.git.dir` is matched as a directory (not as a glob)
  ** Enforce that `input.git.ext` is matched as a file extension (not as a glob)

* Add account selectors as text into Account Selector Checksum metadata

* Change and Add more information to the "Git Storage" metadata
  ** New fields: "author", "date"
  ** Fix name of "message" to "subject" (the content of that field has been git subject all the time)
  ** Change field "suffix" to "extension", don't print the '.'
  ** Change the order of fields (move commit after extension)

* Change default allocator
  ** Replace `tikv-jemallocator` with `mimalloc`
     *** Mimalloc is available on Linux, Windows and MacOS
     *** It's about 20% faster on Linux and Windows, but on MacOS difference is only about 5%
     *** Memory usage increases about 30% an all platforms

* Reject unknown configuration keys

* Add new default configuration key `ext` for `suffix` (for both `fs` and `git` storage). 
  Old config wiht `suffix` key is still supported.
* Add new CLI option `--input.fs.path`
  ** Change the semantics of `--input.fs.dir`, it's now path inside journal (under `--input.fs.path`)
     This is now symmetrical how `--input.git.repo` and `--input.git.dir` behave
* Allow overriding storage options from CLI without full storage configuration
